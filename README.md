# About Me
Hi, I’m Emir Ekin Ors, a passionate software engineer with a strong foundation in computer science and a keen interest in building innovative, user-friendly applications. I’m currently studying an MSc in Artificial Intelligence at Maastricht University after earning my BSc in Computer Engineering. I’ve gained experience as a full-stack developer, designing and developing websites, mobile applications, and backend systems using tools like Laravel, Flutter, and React. Through various internships and projects, I’ve tackled exciting challenges, such as creating a startup about smart shopping assistant app that won €30,000 in funding. Beyond coding, I enjoy playing football, chess, and reading books on sci-fi and philosophy. I’m always eager to learn, grow, take on new challenges, and contribute to meaningful projects.
