# About Me
Hi, I’m Emir Ekin Ors, a passionate software engineer with a strong foundation in computer science and a drive to build innovative, user friendly applications. I have experience as a full-stack developer, working with Laravel, PHP, React, and Flutter to create scalable web and mobile applications.
I enjoy not only writing code but also taking ownership of projects, ensuring that the software I develop meets real user needs and delivers visible value. I take an active role in project management and client communication. I have worked directly with clients to understand their requirements, propose solutions, and iterate based on feedback. My curiosity drives me to explore new technologies and continuously improve my skills.
Beyond coding, I enjoy playing football, chess, and reading books on sci-fi and philosophy. I’m always eager to learn, grow, take on new challenges, and contribute to meaningful projects.
