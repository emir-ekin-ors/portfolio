                <div class="description">Hi, I’m Emir Ekin Ors, a passionate software engineer with a strong foundation
                    in computer science and a keen interest in creating innovative, user-friendly applications. I am
                    currently pursuing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence at Maastricht University building on the
                    foundation of my BSc in Computer Engineering. I’ve gained experience as a full-stack developer,
                    designing and developing websites, mobile applications, and backend systems using tools like
                    Laravel, Flutter, and React. Beyond coding, I enjoy playing football, chess, and reading books on
                    sci-fi and philosophy. I’m always eager to learn, grow, take on new challenges, and contribute to
                    meaningful projects.
